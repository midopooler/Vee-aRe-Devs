project title:- Indoor Navigation for large malls

Prezi ppt link:- https://prezi.com/p/z3i37er1lvzy/

idea:-  the idea is to make a indoor navigation app for a large sized mall in delhi. So that people could track their routes to the nearby shops and restrooms.

project description:- the objective is to make indoor navigation easier via augmented reality and more effective marketing by attracting youth to the new technology.
                      We have dreamed to place AR arrows in front of the user (in their mobiles) which will guide them to their required destination.
                      We want to build routes from one place to another iniside malls which can be done through AR navigation instead of asking people to people for directions or either searching for direction boards.
                      After the campaign gets over, we would wish to increase our database from one mall to multiple malls. Plus, We would look forward to make UI/UX a lot better using the android studio.
instructions to use:- /* 
                          This is applicable only for TDI Mall right now (Google map location:-https://goo.gl/maps/ECV6hvr8f5q2WjQs8)
                       */
1. Get inside the mall and open the application
2. scan your surrounding area to let the app decide where you are. (only applicable in open area of mall, not inside the shops.)
3. Tell the app where you want to go.
4. the app will guide you through the AR arrows augmented on the floors.


For vuforia, It will launch automatically when triggered with a image target. (to be implemented in future.)
Seperate apk is provided in the source code file.you just have to scan the KFC logo to use it.
